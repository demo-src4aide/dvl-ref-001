# android_dvl_smp_01
My first project in learning to do Android programming

## Purpose
For the purpose of having a reference to read back on things that I learn in
Android development (so as to no longer have to re-learn everything from
scratch each time, thereby never getting to the point of actually being
productive) I decided to start a project of setting up apps who's source
codes are well enough mined with comments as to be clear references for me.
