	It seems to control the name of the app

	Originally, this string was also the value

	In the <activity> tag who's 'android:name'

	the 'android:label' attribute to reference
	the following, newly-created string (rather
	than the above one). As expected, it affects
	the app name as displayed within the activity.
	Furthermore, to my surprise, it affects the
	name of the app as displayed when I go into
	the Android view that displays *all* apps
	installed on the device.
