	It seems to control the name of the app
	reflected in install time.

	Originally, this string was also the value
	of the 'android:label' attribure of the main
	activity tag as well - but I changed it so
	as to see what the difference is in the
	significance of those two attributes.

	In the <activity> tag who's 'android:name'
	has a value of '.MainActivity', I changed
	the 'android:label' attribute to reference
	the following, newly-created string (rather
	than the above one). As expected, it affects
	the app name as displayed within the activity.
	Furthermore, to my surprise, it affects the
	name of the app as displayed when I go into
	the Android view that displays *all* apps
	installed on the device.
